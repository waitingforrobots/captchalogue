		<h1>PROBLEM SLEUTH FOREWORD, V.1.1</h1>
		<p class="author">By Ryan North</p>
		<p>You’re on the top of a mountain, and it’s unbelievably dramatic. The peak is barely enough to contain you, the chair you’re sitting in, and the desk you’re sitting in front of. Wind swirls around you, and the sky threatens a storm big enough to wipe all humanity from the face of the planet. Peering cautiously over your left armrest, you see that you’re sitting at the top of a sheer cliff, one whose bottom is thankfully obscured by mist several kilometers below. What appears to be a giant hawk or a tiny pterosaur circles lazily just above the mist. Looking over your right armrest means to look over the other side of the mountain top. You see a similar cliff, this one with lava shooting out in a beautiful arc about halfway down and ending in a glowing pool of molten rock far below. Returning your gaze to your desk you see a scrap of paper with some writing on it. There’s a pencil on the desk too. It’s a miracle the paper hasn’t blown away.</p>
<h2 class="command">> quickly retrieve paper from desk</h2>
<p>No problem! A task like this is easily achieved to everyone’s satisfaction. You now clutch PAPER in your left fist.</p>
<h2 class="command">> take pencil</h2>
<p>You now clutch a SHARPENED PENCIL in your right fist. Nice. You look like the manliest author ever. You’re ready to throw down some mad ESSAYS.</p>
<h2 class="command">> look paper</h2>
<p> Okay. You unclench your left fist, which causes the now crinkled CRUMPLED PAPER to fall to the desk. Smoothing it out with your right fist, you see that someone has written on it. A heading at the top reads “PROBLEM SLEUTH FOREWORD”. Written in unerasable black ink. The words underneath the heading are written in pencil. Here’s what they say. </p>
<p>“Problem Sleuth is a comic / adventure / game / exploration of weird puzzle shit written by Andrew Hussie. The readers of the comic told the protagonists what to do next, which resulted in a freewheeling adventure that never devolved into stupid stuff because Andrew’s knowledgeable hand kept the course true, targeted faillessly on “comedy bronze, silver and gold”. If you’re reading Problem Sleuth for the first time, congratulations. Get ready for the best game you’ll never play.</p>
<p>Man, you could probably do better.</p>
<h2 class="command">> rewrite paper</h2>
<p>Nice. You wield the ERASER on the back of the SHARPENED PENCIL held in your meaty fist and rub away what’s there. You replace it with:</p>
<p>“Problem Sleuth is a comic featuring dozens of male characters (“sleuths”, “inspectors”, “kingpins” and, tellingly, “dicks”) and a handful of female characters (“nervous broads”, “hysterical dames”). From a normative gendosociological perspective, it’s interesting to note that the only way a female character can enter the narrative of Problem Sleuth is through an (imaginary?) gender inversion of the Male. It’s clear that Hussie, through these means, assures the reader that femininity can in fact be explored, but always within the “safe word” of the masculine: never are we truly female, Hussie reminds us, unless and until we are wrapped in the skin of the gendered male.”</p>
<p>You put down the pencil and stare at your own words with unbelieving disgust.</p>
<h2 class="command">> rewrite paper, focusing on the game interface mechanic</h2>
<p>Now we’re talking. You put PENCIL to CRUMPLED PAPER and here’s what comes out:</p>
<p>“Reading Problem Sleuth is like playing a game, but it’s an impossible game, in the best possible sense of the word. It’s a game where the game designer has anticipated your every whim and programmed for it in advance. It’s a game where exploration is limitless, and where when you say “Never mind, what’s under the phone?” the game’s parser doesn’t respond with “Sorry, I don’t understand NEVER, MIND, WHAT’S, UNDER, THE, and PHONE”. Instead it straight up shows you what’s under the phone, describes it for you too, and then it points out a numerical double entendre involving boobs, just in case you missed it.</p>
<p>This is the game we’ve always deserved, and it’s our privilege that Andrew Hussie gave it to us. What I say now I say without hesitation or hyperbole: this game and its parser are great, and Andrew is the genius we have to thank. His mind is as sharp as the line defined by his sculpted chest. His quads: truly blasted.”</p>
<p>You, um, go on for quite a bit, describing Andrew’s body in detail, eventually turning the crumpled paper over so you can write on the back., You repeatedly assure the reader – which, I hesitate to remind you, is yourself – that Andrew’s quadricepts are extremely well-developed. Honestly it’s pretty embarrassing and I looked away for most of it.</p>
<h2 class="command">> okay rewrite paper for real this time!!!!!!</h2>
<p>That’s what I’m talking about! You focus all your mental energies, marshaling them towards the best possible writing possible in this or any other universe. Here’s what you write!</p>
</p>“Problem Sleuth is unique, hilarious, and great. Andrew’s not only come up with a fantastic comic, he’s also come up with a fantastic new way to make comics. Set some time aside, start at the beginning, and go look in a mirror right now. Point at yourself. Mouth these words to your reflection: ‘You’re in for a treat’.”</p>
<p>That’s not bad.</p>
<p>The CRUMPLED PAPER in your inventory has been replaced with CRUMPLED MARGINALLY ACCEPTABLE INTRODUCTION. Congratulations! Your score is now 1 out of a possible 20,000 points. You regard your CRUMPLED MARGINALLY ACCEPTABLE INTRODUCTION fondly. Then, lightning strikes your desk. We’re on top of a mountain and on the cusp of a storm, remember? Everything’s really dramatic up here! I don’t know how you could have forgotten that!</p>
<h2 class="command">> look desk</h2>
<p>Okay so the lightning didn’t really do any damage.</p>
<h2 class="command">> phew</h2>
<p>I know, right? But it does cause you to finally notice that there’s a COMPUTER on your desk. How did you miss that before? And there’s games installed on it too! You could have been doing something fun literally MINUTES ago instead of wasting your time with this CRUMPLED MARGINALLY ACCEPTABLE INTRODUCTION.</p>
<p class="commands">
PROBSLUT.EXE
SEPULCHR.COM
PONG2000.EXE
</p>
<h2 class="command">> run probslut.exe</h2>
<p>Wow, I guess they really thought that was their best option for contracting “Problem Sleuth” to eight characters. You type in “probslut”, hit return, and as the game loads you prepare yourself to enjoy either the upcoming Problem Sleuthing or Problematic Sluts. An ANTICIPATORY GRIN spreads across your face.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
