			<p>This page details the history of Problem Sleuth, Homestuck, and their related works' publication in physical print media. All authors commentary can be read here (link eventually) or in <a href="https://413.gay">The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</a><p>
			<h2 class="greendrop head">PROBLEM SLEUTH</h2>
			<p> <i>Problem Sleuth</i>'s first (and to date only) print adaptation was published by webcomics merchandiser <i>Topatoco</i> and sold through their <a href="https://www.topatoco.com">Web Store</a>. Each volume covers approximately 4 chapters in somewhere around 200 pages along with author's commentary and new titlecards for each chapter. Coinciding with the release of <i>Problem Sleuth Book 5: Sepulchritude</i>, <i>Topatoco</i> released <i>The Complete Deluxe Problem Sleuth</i>, a repackaging of all five volumes housed in a new slipcase.</p>

			<h2 class="greendrop head">HOMESTUCK</h2>
			<p>The first stab at releasing <i>Homestuck</i> in print would occur during <i>Problem Sleuth</i>'s print run, also published by <i>Topatoco</i>. Each book covered one Act of <i>Homestuck</i> with authors commentary, however, the line would end for unspecified reasons following the release of Book 3. Presumably - and I do hope you'll forgive my editorializing - because they didn't think anyone would buy a book exclusively covering The Intermission.</p>

			<p>Starting in 2018 <i>Viz Media</i>, which had accquired the publishing rights from <i>What Pumpkin</i> the year prior, would begin releasing new hardcover editions of <i>Homestuck</i>. While initially promising to "just keep turning out volumes until the entire story is in print", only 6 volumes were published, covering up to midway through Act 5 Act 2. Each book is approximately 450 pages and features new covers illustrated by <a href="https://paperseverywhere.tumblr.com/">Adrienne Garcia</a>. Volume One (Acts 1 and 2) and the first half of Volume Two (Act 3 and The Intermission) are reprints of the Topatoco releases with minor changes.</p> In May of 2021, one year after the release of Volume 6, Viz confirmed via email (link eventually) that they had no plans to continue their releases. In January of 2024, the <i>Homestuck: Beyond Canon</i> team confirmed  via <a href="https://beyondcanon.com/news/newspost-1704167374">News Post</a> that <i>Viz</i> no longer held the publishing rights to <i>Homestuck</i>.</p>

			<p>In July of 2018, <i>Viz Media</i> would bring <i>Homestuck</i> to <i>Anime Expo</i> as part of their yearly booth, where they would offer limited editions of Homestuck Books 1 and 2 with exclusive dust covers. These would later also be available at <i>New York Comic Con 2018</i>.</p>
