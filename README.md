# captchalogue.com
This is the development repository for captchalogue.com, a Homestuck fansite. It's currently a work in progress.

Feel free to submit pr's for just about whatever at this stage.  

Homestuck belongs to Viz (maybe) and Andrew Hussie (probably) and What Pumpkin (seeming less likely with every update?) I hate to say credit to the owner but fuck dude at this point who even actually owns homestuck and its related assets is kinda a mystery? is it viz? i think its viz. if its not viz and anyone cares feel free to email me about it. if i dont get an email either it belongs to viz or the people who *do* own it dont give enough of a shit to correct me, i guess.

also while im looking at this special fangzzzz to my friend Thali who did the javascript for the ad thingy. special fangzz (get it because im goffik)
