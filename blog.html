				If you're reading this, it means the site is live! We are currently still working on some things, so you might notice a few pages are under construction. DON'T PANIC! They'll be up soon. Because this site has spent some time in development, here's a list of things that have occured during development, in roughly chronological order. </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Topatoco started stocking God Tier shirts and hoodies, and a bit later the "cosplay accurate" beta and alpha kids tees were restocked. Neat! </li>
					<li> Unity, the engine which the Hiveswap games are developed in, had a nice little meltdown after attempting to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">make developers pay per install</a>. They later walked back these new rules but the damage was already done, with many developers switching to other platforms. It's not yet known wether Hiveswap will continue using unity, or how this will effect development. </li>
					<li>Land of Fans and Music 5 Act 2 dropped! Clocking in at a staggering 6 hours of the best fanmusic Homestuck has to offer. Featuring music by INSERT CONTRIBUTORS HERE. </li>								
					<li>Homestuck Daily launched! Inspired by Equestria Daily, Homestuck Daily catalogs new relating to Homestuck, including both fan and official work. You can <a href="https://www.homestuckdaily.com">check it out here</a>
					<li> Out of nowhere, <a href="https://www.homestuck2.com">Homestuck^2</a> updated! Now titled Homestuck:Beyond Canon, the story is being continued by a new team lead by James Roach. This new team is calling themselves The Homestuck Independent Creators Union and features a few familiar faces from both official and fanwork.</li>
					<li> I guess the Opera browser made a fantroll? If corporate pandering through meme culture is your sort of thing it's going down on the website formerly known as twitter. </li>
					<li> SOME OTHER THINGS I FORGOT ABOUT, PROBABLY. </li>
				</ul>
				<p> Boy, that sure was a long list of things. Hopefully by the time you're reading this nothing else important has happened. &lt;--- Tempting fate. </p>
