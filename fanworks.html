					<p class="workauthor">By Victoria Lacroix</p>
					<p>Spoilers for Act 7</p>
					<hr>
					<p class="workdescription"> <i>"Burning Down the House is a webcomic about stories and people who read them. It's a webcomic based on the 2009 webcomic Homestuck, which can never truly be escaped on this site. It's always already here." -<a href="https://spider.zone/BurningDownTheHouse">Author's Website</a></i>
					<br>
					Hussie's first post-homestuck work, Psycholonials is a visual novel about fame, mental health, revolution, and the current internet landscape. The story focuses on Zhen, a depressed 23 year old with ambitions of internet stardom and a lengthy past of call-out posts and public meltdowns behind her. In the throes of the 2021 lockdowns she's spurred by cryptic dreams to revisit her unfinished manifesto, an endeavour which quickly spirals out of control as she finds herself the face of a budding revolution.
					<br>
					With brilliant music by Clark Powell (<i><a href="https://hsmusic.wiki/track/flare">Flare</a> and <a href="https://hsmusic.wiki/track/even-in-death">Even in Death</a></i>) Psycholonials incorporates and expands upon the aesthtic, textual, and metatextual ideas presented in <i>Homestuck</i> and <i>The Homestuck Epilouges</i> while simultaneously standing on its own as a complete work.

					<i> "Kidd Radd is the hero and title character of a 1987 video game. Radd's got an okay life, really. Blasting enemies, moving up levels, beating up bosses, almost by not quite getting the girl... Simple. Hey, it could be worse. Then he discovers a world outside the game. And life gets complicated." -<a href="http://www.sequentialtart.com/reports.php?ID=3240&issue=2004-06-01">Sequential Tart</a></i>

					<i> "The machine had been invented a few years ago: a machine that could tell, just from a sample of your blood, how you were going to die. It didn't give you the date and it didn't give you the specifics. It just spat out a sliver of paper upon which were printed, in careful block letters, the words DROWNED or CANCER or OLD AGE or CHOKED ON A HANDFUL OF POPCORN. It let people know how they were going to die." -<a href="http://www.machineofdeath.net/about">Official Website</a></i>
