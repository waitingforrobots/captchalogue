				<h2>What is Homestuck?</h2>
				<p> Homestuck is a completed multimedia webcomic written by Andrew Hussie. Homestuck follows four kids as they play a video game called <i>Sburb</i> which brings about the end of the world.
				Running from 2009 to 2016, Homestuck spans over 8,000 pages and features animation, music, and games alongside the more traditional text and images. For the first quarter of it's run Homestuck relied on user-submitted commands to determine characters actions, though starting with page 1,560 this was discontinued in favor of being entirely written by Hussie. </p>
				<h2>How Can I Read Homestuck</h2>
				<p>The recomended, and officially endorsed<sup><a href="https://x.com/Bamboshu/status/1433759314708074503">[?]</a></sup> method of reading Homestuck is through <a href="https://blog.giovanh.com/unofficial-homestuck-collection/">The Unofficial Homestuck Collection.</a>, The Unofficial Homestuck Collection is a standalone, offline edition of Homestuck that is downloaded to your computer, and addresses numerous issues with the current official Homestuck website maintained by Viz Media. Most notably, The Unoffiical Homestuck Collection restores and preserves Homestucks extensive use of Adobe Flash, which was deprecated due to security issues in December 2020.</p> 
				<p> Homestuck also has an as-of-writing incomplete print adaptation, published by Viz Media. This version of the story is not reccomended for new readers, both due to it's current abandonment and its exclusion of all multimedia elements.
