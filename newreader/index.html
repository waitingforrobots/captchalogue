				<h2>What is Homestuck?</h2>
				<p> Homestuck is a completed multimedia webcomic written by Andrew Hussie. Homestuck follows four kids as they play a video game called <i>Sburb</i> which brings about the end of the world.
				Running from 2009 to 2016, Homestuck spans over 8,000 pages and features animation, music, and games alongside the more traditional text and images. For the first quarter of it's run Homestuck relied on user-submitted commands to determine characters actions, though starting with page 1,560 this was discontinued in favor of being entirely written by Hussie. </p>
